* __ParametrizANI__ is a repository where you can find a Jupyter notebook scripts to set up a protocol for parametrization of small molecules dihedrals using TorchANI as a reference, a PyTorch-based program for training/inference of ANI (ANAKIN-ME) deep learning models to obtain potential energy surfaces and other physical properties of molecular systems.
